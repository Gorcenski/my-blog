The past month's news in the sphere of transgender rights has been up and down. After [a multi-day Twitch fundraiser](https://inews.co.uk/news/hbomberguy-twitch-stream-trans-childrens-charity-mermaids-donkey-kong-n64/) raised over $300,000 for the Mermaids charity, a UK-based organization dedicated to helping trans children and teenagers, news broke that the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of Donald Trump's transgender military ban. Trans discourse was thrown into chaos once again.

Whenever trans isues make mainstream news, trans people, especially outspoken trans activists, find themselves in the crosshairs of several mendacious and vehement harassment campaigns. These campaigns, many of them centered in the UK, have mainstream celebrity support, and they are well-practiced in the art of disingenuous online rhetoric. This has left the trans community spinning its tires for the last few years, burning an enormous amount of energy to make no real meaningful progress towards liberation.

I have largely avoided engaging in "the discourse" because I have frankly seen it as a waste of my time. There are several trans people out there—Zinnea Jones and Julia Serano come to mind—who are doing good advocacy work while also tearing down anti-trans arguments. This is critically important work, because clear-headed commentary that disambiguates truth from fiction is necessary. But it is worth re-evaluating how the trans community at large engages with this discursive form of hate.

At the foundation, trans-exclusionary arguments resort to a few well-worn tropes, largely fitting [the DARVO pattern](https://dynamic.uoregon.edu/jjf/defineDARVO.html). In essence, the arguments fit more or less variations of the following:

1. Trans women aren't women and trans men aren't men (and non-binary people don't exist);
2. Report, dogpile, and try to silence the trans person;
3. Frame the trans person as an interloper with nefarious intent there to debase a virtuous position.

The effect here is that no meaningful discussion about trans people is encountered. Even when good arguments against the accusations can land, the trans-exclusionary bigots simply revert to a denial of the trans person's gender. They won't concede on that point, so the argument is unwinnable. Arguing in good faith with bad faith actors never works.

The tactic is brilliant in a way; by placing themselves in a fully-defensible position, they declare victory by default, essentially baiting unwitting subjects into running headfirst into impenetrable walls over and over until they die. This pattern goes through multiple iterations to always stay somewhat fresh; one example is how trans-exclusionary movements are claiming that "trans activists" refuse to deny that they want to allow men to enter women's spaces to rape lesbians. This claim is without proof, and it is perfectly crafted to disguise its subtlety behind the outrage it is intended to provoke.

The argument targets the neutral reader's virtue centers. Rape is bad! We don't want people to rape. Homophobia is also bad! And don't we know that it is a common form of anti-lesbian violence for men to try to rape women straight? It is almost worth engaging with. Why won't trans activists denounce those who want to allow men to enter women's spaces to rape lesbians?

This argument should be dismissed on the basis of the outlandishness of it. There are no meaningful, and presumably powerful, civil rights activism movements that are actively campaigning for this, and anyone who thinks that such a thing is reality is probably already two payments deep buying into the right-wing conspiracy theory platform.

But deeper, we can identify the hidden daggers in this message. "Men" here refers not to cisgender men who perpetrate the overwhelming majority of sexual assaults, but is intended as a dogwhistle to refer to transgender women as sexual deviants. This is, of course, a central argument in right-wing talking points about trans people when promoting legislation to ban us from public restrooms.
