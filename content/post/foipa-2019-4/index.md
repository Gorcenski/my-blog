Hours before the torch rally, the FBI called me to investigate an anonymous tip that was submitted where someone claimed I was planning an "ANTIFA terror attack." I was not.

The day before Unite the Right, the FBI called me about a tip they received where someone was accusing me of plotting a terror attack. Obviously, I was not. I spoke to them briefly, and they questioned me about my plans for the rally. I truthfully told them that I had been working to ensure non-violent participation, that I had reached out to people on all sides to encourage non-violence, and to plan for a safe day. My subsequent actions prove that I was telling the truth.

Note that the FBI invested this much time in investigating a clearly nonsensical allegation. This call was at 4:50 PM, and the two agents on the call could have been using their time investigating the neo-Nazis who were planning violence that night and the next day. Incredibly, they missed or ignored the fact that the man who _did_ commit the terror attack [posted his intentions to commit vehicular terror on Instagram](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-protests-idUSKCN1UA0TV) well in advance.

I made a mistake here by not having an attorney present for the call. Never talk to cops without a lawyer.

Pink boxes are personal data pertaining to myself that I redacted.
