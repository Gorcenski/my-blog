This is my FBI 302 from when I was interviewed as a victim of Christopher Cantwell's [violent assault](https://www.c-ville.com/cantwell-pleads-guilty/).

<!--more-->

I was interviewed by the FBI about the August 11 torch march. They told me they were investigating Christopher Cantwell and others for potential riot charges. I was interviewed with my lawyer present as a victim and did so on the advice of several attorneys, including my own.

There are some details that they got wrong during their transcription. For instance, I did not say that counter-demonstrators at the statue were _with_ Black Lives Matter, I said that they were chanting the words, "black lives matter." Moreover, I did not say I found out about the torch rally from Unicorn Riot's Discord Leaks. I said that Unicorn Riot later released information about it in the Discord Leaks.

My statements here are verifiably truthful. For instance, I said that I observed Chris Cantwell's meetup at the Wal Mart parking lot at around 12:10 PM. Photo metadata that I have from that rally supports this.

Pink boxes are personal data pertaining to myself that I redacted.
