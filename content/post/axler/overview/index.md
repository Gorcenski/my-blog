During my undergrad, I took a linear algebra class that I struggled with enough to switch sections to another professor early in the semester. A big reason I switched classes was the text, _Linear Algebra Done Right_ by Sheldon Axler.

<!--more-->

I despised the presentation of the book; I found its tone and title arrogant, and a lack of worked examples stunted my learning. I had extensive experience with matrix algebra in the past, but this class presented the material abstractly. I wasn't prepared for that.

At that point, I hadn't learned how to prove things properly. I hadn't learned the meaning of abstraction and I had struggled with non-computational mathematics. This book didn't present itself well to me, and I still find it's writing to be a bit non-obvious at times. But I wanted to revisit this book so many years later, now that I am intellectually more mature and with a better understanding of the text under my belt.

So I'm going to work through it again, to see how I'm doing. I'm working through the Second Edition. [The book](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/0387982582) is now in its third edition; I don't know what changes have been made, but I think the second edition is perfectly suitable for refreshing my undergraduate knowledge of the topic.

I'll go through the book chapterwise; direct links to worked exercises will be updated here.
