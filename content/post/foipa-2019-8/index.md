In 2018, neo-Nazis threatened me by sending me a letter to my home address. This is the brief regarding that threat.

<!--more-->

I received a letter that looked sketchy in late 2018. On the advice of my attorneys, I did not open it and handed it to the police as evidence. They sent it to the FBI. The return address on the letter was handwritten; it was the address of the Anti-Defamation League's Houston office. The FBI bizarrely seems to infer that that address is the genuine address of the sender.
