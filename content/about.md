<p style="display: block; margin-top: -9px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Hi there! I'm Emily F. Gorcenski, and this is my personal website. Before going further, please note that I am highly opinionated, but those strong opinions belong only to me and I am not speaking for my employer or any other organization unless stated otherwise. I am a data scientist by profession, a mathematician and engineer by training, and an activist by passion. I am somewhat of a digital nomad, though I am from Charlottesville, and the events of 2017 in Charlottesville have strongly informed my activism. On this page, you'll find a brief CV, bio, and other information that you might care about or need.

### Short Autobiography

I find it difficult sometimes to write about myself, because even after all this time I don't know what _identity_ is. Certainly, there are many ways I can identify, because there are many things that I _am_. I am a data scientist, by profession. I am an engineer, by training. I am an activist, by passion. I am a mathematician, by degree. I am a queer transgender woman, by existence. I am an immigrant, by necessity. In the end, though, those are words and labels to describe what I _do_, and I try to live in such a way that the things that I do are more interesting than the things that I _am_. Perhaps I should discuss that.

I work as a data scientist, presently for ThoughtWorks Deutschland (don't bother complaining to them if you don't like my opinions, as the opinions I share here are mine alone). As a data scientist and consultant, I advise and educate clients on ways to make use of data in ways that bring value. I build data-driven systems. And I try to build them ethically, seeking problems worth solving to make the world better. If you'd like to see some of my work on technology ethics, see the conference link below, or just follow this blog.

My background in data science comes from perhaps an ununsual place. I am an engineer by training. I studied Aeronautical and Mechanical engineering at Rensselaer (though my degree is in Applied and Computation Mathematics). I worked for almost a decade as a research engineer, working in signal processing and control theory. Yes, much of this work was funded by the Department of Defense, a fact I neither hide nor take pride in. I no longer work for Defense-funded projects and have not in some time.

It used to be hard to be educated in the aerospace industry and not work in defense. But my actual degree, for reasons I will not belabor here, is in Mathematics. Specifically, I've studied uncertainty quantification and dynamical systems. I loved math more than I loved engineering, and so switched my degree at the last minute to finish while I still had some student aid. I deeply love mathematics, so much that I have tattoos of abstract mathematical ideas (ask me sometime about FizzBuzz).

I'm also, however, a researcher. My particular skillset is what is sometimes called _technology transition_, which is the awkward space between fundamental research and production engineering, a space which requires one to understand and speak many technical languages. It's my skills as a researcher that have made me effective at data science. It's also what's made me effective as an activist.

When neo-Nazis and white supremacists came to my home of Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, I knew I could not sit by and watch them bring their violence and hate to those streets unopposed. I needed to fight back, and the best way I know how to fight is to use information and truth as a weapon. So I did just that, first by trying to shut the rally down, then by showing the unfiltered truth of their hate, and then by holding them accountable to their violence by exposing them, tracking their crimes, and shining sunlight on their bigotry.

This work has continued in a quasi-professional context. I sit on the advisory boards of the Prosecution Project at Miami University in Ohio, and on the Youth Equity and Sexuality Laboratory at Suffolk University, two research labs studying extremist violence. I have co-written a book chapter on lessons that can be learned from activism in the technology space and vice-versa. I have been consulted as an expert on several issues regarding far-right violence internationally.

That work has not been without a cost. As a transgender woman, my identity makes me vulnerable to bigotry. And as someone who has metaphorically punched their movement in the face (quite hard, I'd like to think), this has made me a target. I experience regular threats, and my home has been threatened enough that I made the decision, for personal safety and mental health reasons, to emigrate to Berlin, Germany, where I now live.

Berlin has given me the space to find my creative energy once again. I poured some of that energy into [First Vigil](https://first-vigil.com/), a database of recent and ongoing court-cases involving right-wing extremist violence and hate crimes. For that work, I've been given accolades; among them, I was named as [one of 2018's most influential feminists by Bitch Magazine](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/2018-bitch-50).

Despite the high stakes of the work I've done, I feel privileged nevertheless as it has allowed me to understand my purpose and what drives me. I want to create a world where I can be at peace, and to create that world with the talents I have, I see two things that I can do: by helping make technology good, and by helping to make white supremacy and bigotry untenable with every fiber of my being. And in the end, I hope I can tell a good story from it all.

Thanks for reading. May we move ever foward, together.

**Research Engineer: Barron Associates, Inc., Charlottesville, USA**<br />
_April 2008 — May 2016_

Barron Associates, Inc. is a small research engineering firm specializing in real-time control systems, simulation, and mathematical modeling in the aerospace, automotive, and biotechnology fields. Predominantly working in technology transition—the complex space between core research and technology implementation—Barron Associates helped move technologies and methodologies from university laboratories to production environments within industry and government.

Emily served Barron Associates as a Research Engineer. Using her background in computational mathematics, she worked on interdisciplinary teams with world-class domain experts to help demonstrate and prove complex algorithms and ideas in real-world environments. In addition, she wrote winning grant proposals for new work, led multi-center teams, and presented the company’s work and vision before industry and academic professionals. A sample of her projects is presented below.

**Intelligent Prognostics for Vehicle Maintenance Planning**

_Objective_: Using engine, powertrain, and vehicle telemetry, dynamically detect degraded performance to schedule preventative maintenance and allow for greater variability in maintenance schedules.

_Approach_: Using MATLAB and Simulink, developed a high-fidelity model of engine and vehicle dynamics. Applied modeling approach to large-scale real-world datasets to identify performance and detect failures. Used inverse methods to correct for sensor bias and noise. Applied Kalman filtering techniques for fault detection.

**Neural Networks for Low-Resolution Image Classification**

_Objective_: Develop a method for identifying humans in variable sea-state conditions using low-resolution radar images.

_Approach_: With the requirements of running on real-time embedded hardware, developed a feature extraction pipeline based on Hough Transformations to extract image data. Built a multiclass classification algorithm using polynomial neural networks. Trained and validated data in a real-world environment using a functional radar platform.

**Wearable Health Tracker for Lower-Limb Amputees**

_Objective_: Develop a wearable IoT health monitor for lower-Limb combat amputees capable of assessing physical health in people with complex medical needs.

_Approach_: Designed algorithms for a photoplethysmography-based health monitor capable of being embedded within gel prosthetics linings. Ensured algorithms would be functional in atypical conditions e.g. tissue ossification, where commercial health trackers generally fail.

**Image Analysis for Automated Corrosion Mapping**

_Objective_: Develop software capable of identifying corrosion pits in laser profilometry scans of nickel-based superalloys corroded at high temperature with sulfur-based salts.

_Approach_: Used regularization methods to detect pits while preserving surface geometries where convolutional methods would typically fail. Built algorithms for automating volumetric measurement and classifying inclusions to detect conditions that would lead to adverse stress concentrations. Designed software package to output results to commercially-available failure prediction tools.
