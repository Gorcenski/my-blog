## Short Autobiography

I am a data scientist and engineer by training and a social justice activist by passion. Occasionally, I write about politics, software, and politics-in-software. I am also a regular conference speaker.

I studied Aeronautical Engineering and Mathematics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. My degree is in Mathematics, and my focus is on Numerical Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification. My undergraduate research fellowship was done at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and I spent the first part of my career in research and development before shifting to data science and engineering. I have worked in a wide range of technical fields, from aerospace control systems, signal processing, video game development, occupational therapy for rehabilitation, and more. Some of my work is summarized in my [CV below]({{< relref "#curriculum-vitae" >}}). Presently, I work as a data science and data engineering consultant for ThoughtWorks Germany, where I help clients build high-quality data-driven, intelligent software applications efficiently.

In addition to my regular professional work, I also sit on the advisory boards of the Prosecution Project at Miami University in Ohio (Dr. Michael Loadenthal), and on the Youth Equity and Sexuality Laboratory at Suffolk University (Dr. Mimi Arbeit), two research labs studying violent extremism. My experience in contemporary right-wing extremism is driven in large part by my personal experiences as a survivor of neo-Nazi terrorism in my home city of Charlottesville, Virginia, when terrorists came to the Unite the Right neo-Nazi hate rally intent on doing violence. As part of my efforts to understand right-wing extremist violence, I created [First Vigil](https://first-vigil.com/), a database of criminal cases involving hate crimes, right-wing anti-government extremists, and white supremacist violence. For that work, I've been given accolades; among them, I was named as [one of 2018's most influential feminists by Bitch Magazine](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/2018-bitch-50) and later [profiled in _The Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/01/white-supremacist-protest-activism-emily-gorcenski).

My research in counter-extremism work has been part of several stories. My research, footage, and experiences were part of [_Documenting Hate_](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/documenting-hate-charlottesville/), a documentary by PBS Frontline and ProPublica that won an Emmy in 2019. The Peabody and Emmy Award-winning documentary, [_Charlottesville: Race and Terror_](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvzn8p/vice-news-tonight-full-episode-charlottesville-race-and-terror) focused on neo-Nazi Christopher Cantwell, who days later became internationally-known as "The Crying Nazi" after learning I had sworn a felony warrant against him. I was depicted as a fictionalized character in _American Horror Story: Cult_, and I have been the focus of several news stories, including [a front-page feature in the _Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/he-once-defended-the-poor-in-court-now-he-defends-white-supremacists/2018/07/01/0c7bfa6a-6901-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637_story.html), [a profile in _Motherboard_](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbyvjn/the-data-scientist-tracking-americas-white-supremacists-emily-gorcenski-first-vigil), [a profile in _The Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/01/white-supremacist-protest-activism-emily-gorcenski), and [a profile in _Die Tageszeitung_ (German)](https://taz.de/Emily-Gorcenski-enttarnt-US-Neonazis/!5749588/).

From time-to-time, I turn my research and experience into published analysis and opinion, some of which are linked in [the Publications section]({{< relref "#publications" >}}) of my CV below. I am available as a guest on TV appearances and have appeared on programs from _TODAY_ to Al Jazeera's _The Stream_. Please email me at the above email address if you would like me to appear on your segment. I am also available for conference talks. For previous talks, please see [the Conferences section]({{< relref "#selected-conferences" >}}) below. I am currently offering talks in the following topic areas:

- continuous delivery for data-driven software;
- data reliability engineering;
- the social role of technology and technologists in contemporary society;
- joyful intersections of math and technology.

Thanks for reading!
